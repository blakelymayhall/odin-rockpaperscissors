# odin-rockpaperscissors
Repo for the Rock Paper Scissors project in the JavaScript fundamentals section 

# Intro:
The original javascript source code for the rock paper scissors game was written in an earlier project during the odin-project.

This project is meant to give the student creative liberty to make a UI and provide functionality via JavaScript.

This will require code refactoring and iteration on the UI to be dynamic, and user-friendly.
